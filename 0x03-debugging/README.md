# 0x03-debugging

Welcome to the **0x03-debugging** directory! ðŸš§

This project folder is part of the **alx-low_level_programming** repository and focuses on debugging techniques in **C programming**. Debugging is a critical skill for identifying and fixing errors in code, and this project provides hands-on exercises to practice and master these skills.

---

## Description

The **0x03-debugging** directory contains tasks and examples designed to help understand and implement effective debugging strategies. By going through these exercises, you'll become more proficient at identifying and resolving issues in your code.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will learn:
- How to read and interpret error messages.
- Common debugging techniques, such as using print statements and debuggers.
- How to fix issues in existing code to ensure it compiles and runs correctly.

---

## Directory Structure

- **`main.h`**: Header file containing function prototypes and macros used in the debugging tasks.
- **`0-main.c`**: A sample file to test whether a function behaves as expected.
- **`1-main.c`**: Debugged version of a problematic script.
- Additional `.c` files: Contain code examples that require debugging or have been debugged.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lameckirungu/alx-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the 0x03-debugging directory:
```bash
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x03-debugging
```
3. Compile the C files using gcc:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
./<output_name>
```
