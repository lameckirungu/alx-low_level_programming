# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of C programs developed as part of the `0x1C. C - Makefiles` project at ALX Software Engineering School. The project aims to introduce the concept of Makefiles and provide hands-on experience in creating them.

5. [Tasks](#tasks)
6. [Island Perimeter](#island-perimeter)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what make and Makefiles are.
- Learn when, why, and how to use Makefiles.
- Understand rules and how to set and use them.
- Differentiate between explicit and implicit rules.
- Learn about common and useful rules.
- Understand variables and how to set and use them.

## Requirements

- **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`,`emacs`
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Version of `gcc`:** 9.3.0
- **Version of `make`:** GNU Make 4.2.1
- **All files should end with a new line.**

## Project Structure

- **0x1C-makefiles/**
  - **0-Makefile**: Create your first Makefile.
  - **1-Makefile**: Specify compiler and source files in the Makefile.
  - **2-Makefile**: Create a useful Makefile with additional variables.
  - **3-Makefile**: Implement advanced rules like clean, oclean, fclean, and re.
  - **4-Makefile**: Complete Makefile with compiler flags and advanced rules.
  - **5-island_perimeter.py**: Python function for calculating island perimeter.
  - **README.md**: This README file.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired Makefile directory (`0x1C-makefiles`).
3. Use the `make` command followed by the filename (e.g., `0-Makefile`, `1-Makefile`, etc.) to execute the Makefile and build the executable.
4. Refer to each Makefile's specific instructions and tasks for more details.

## Tasks

Each Makefile corresponds to a specific task. Here's a brief overview:
- **0-Makefile**: Create the first Makefile.
- **1-Makefile**: Specify compiler and source files.
- **2-Makefile**: Introduce additional variables and rules.
- **3-Makefile**: Implement advanced rules like clean, oclean, fclean, and re.
- **4-Makefile**: Complete Makefile with compiler flags and advanced rules.

## Island Perimeter

The `5-island_perimeter.py` file contains a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island described in a grid. It follows specific requirements and restrictions, as outlined in the file.
